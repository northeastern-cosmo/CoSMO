                    <InfoSection ref={ref}>We're building a supportive community in the computer science discipline and providing resources to help guide students interested in Computer Science. CoSMOâ€™s mentorship program creates an additional layer of support for students entering Northeastern and exploring Computer Science. Beyond the larger CoSMO community, the mentorship program allows students new to Computer Science to connect with an older Khoury student on a more personal level. One-on-one mentorship relationships are great opportunities, whether you have specific questions regarding co-op, adapting to life as a student at Northeastern, or a career in computer science.</InfoSection>
                    <InfoSection>The mentorship program runs during both the fall and spring semesters. Sign-ups are currently open for mentors and mentees. No experience is necessary to join the program, and everyone who signs up will be paired with a mentor.</InfoSection>
                    <InfoSection>Check out our mentorship FAQ or contact us for more information!</InfoSection>
